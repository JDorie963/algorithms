# Tic Tac Toe with PyQt5

A graphical Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and PyQt5, featuring a user-friendly interface and a computer opponent powered by the minimax algorithm for optimal gameplay.

## Features

- **Welcome Screen**: A starting page with options to begin the game or exit the application.
- **Game Board**: A 3x3 interactive board with clear visuals.
- **Single Player**: Play against an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm.
- **Dynamic Turns**: The game alternates between player X and AI O.
- **Win Detection**: Recognizes winning combinations or draws and displays the result.
- **Play Again or Exit**: Prompts the player to restart or return to the main menu after the game ends.

## How to Play

1. Launch the application using `python main.py`.
2. From the welcome screen, click "Start Game" to begin.
3. Player X (you) always starts.
4. Click on an empty square to make your move.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py         # Entry point of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ game_page.py    # Core logic and GUI for the game
```

### File Descriptions
- **`main.py`**: Initializes the application and launches the welcome page.
- **`game_page.py`**: Contains the game logic, including the welcome page, gameplay mechanics, AI implementation, and UI design.

## AI Logic
The AI opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate optimal moves:

- **Maximizing Player**: AI (Player O) tries to maximize its score.
- **Minimizing Player**: Human (Player X) tries to minimize the AI's score.
- **Recursive Backtracking**: Explores all possible game states to find the optimal move.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add multiplayer functionality for two human players.
- Enhance the UI with animations and sound effects.
- Implement difficulty levels for the AI.
- Add a score tracking system.
